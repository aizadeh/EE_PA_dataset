This directory contains the data and information about the data used in the analysis 
presented in article "East European Sedimentary Basins Long Heated by a Fading 
Mantle Upwelling" by Alik Ismail-Zadeh, Anne Davaille, Jean Besse, and Yuri Volozh
published in Nature Communications.

Content

The data generated in this study have been deposited as .dat files or .zip files 
(which contains .dat files) in this database. The data (paleogeographic maps) used 
in Fig. S1 can be made available upon a request and a justification of their use, 
due to data privacy laws.

Fig. 1
illustrates along selected cross-sections the data of the (a) SMEAN model and the 
(b) SEMUCB-WM1 model. The SMEAN model is a global, composite mantle tomography 
model constructed by Becker and Boschi (2002) by averaging existing S wave models 
with the goal to emphasize common structure. The SMEAN model data used in Fig. 1 
are available at: https://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/tdata.html#smean
The information and the data on the SEMUCB-WM1 model used in Fig. 1 are available at:
https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-semucb-wm1/

Fig. 2
- Panel a) represents an image of a laboratory experiment performed by Anne Davallie. 
- Panels b)-f) (the upper part) show the snapshots of the plate tectonic reconstruction animation 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLahVJNnoZ4). Orininal data for this animation can be made 
availble by the author: Scotese, C.R., 2004. Plate Tectonics and Paleogeography (animation), 
PALEOMAP Project, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas. 
- Panels b)-f) (the lower part) use the isothermal surface of mantle plume model 
from Ismail-Zadeh et al. (2006)
- Panel g) is based on the data from the model by Cottaar & Lekic (2016) 
(https://www.geol.umd.edu/facilities/seismology/data/) 

Fig. 3 
uses the data on (i) the position of boreholes (see file Fig3_wells.dat) and 
(ii) the tracks of the projection of the Perm Anomaly plume's center on the surface 
(see file Fig3_GPMtracks.dat). 

Fig. 4 
uses data on normalized tectonic subsidence in the several sedimentary basins of the 
East European platform: the Pricaspian basin, Moscow basin, Timan-Pechora basin, and 
Pre-Uralian foredeep (see file Fig04_subsid.rar)

Fig. 5 
uses data  on the surface heat flow and temperature depths 6 km and 10 km 
as the solution to the thermal conductive problem presented in the paper 
(see file FIg5_ther_cond.rar)

Fig. S1
uses the image from the publication by Torsvik & Domeier (2017) 
(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-00125-2). The figure is modified by the authors.

Fig. S2
uses the data from the upper mantle shear velocity model CU_SRT1.0 of 
Shapiro & Ritzwoller (2002) using the interactive plotting tools that are on the 
CUB model main page (http://ciei.colorado.edu/~nshapiro/MODEL/plot_forms.html). 

Fig. S3
uses the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary data from: https://osf.io/twksd/ 
(subfolder: supplementary_datasets/lithopsheric_thickness_maps/global/SL2013sv/SL2013sv.csv) 

Fig. S4 
uses the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary data from: 
http://www.lithosphere.info/downloads.html. Irina Artemieva provided higher resolution data.

Fig. S5 
uses data from Fig. 3. See files Fig3_wells.rar (for the position of boreholes) and  
file Fig3_GPMtracks.rar (for the tracks of the projection of the Perm Anomaly plume's 
center on the surface). 

Figs.S6, S8, S10, and S12
Data (on tectonic subsidence) used in the figures are available in file Figs_S6_S8_S10_S12_data.rar.

Figs. S7, S9, and S11 
Data on the location of the wells used in these figures can be found in Fig3_wells.dat.
